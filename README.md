In this design, a servo motor is connected to an Arduino board.
The setup involves wiring the servo motor to the Arduino to receive control signals.
The Arduino is programmed with code to manage the servo motor's rotation angle.
Power is supplied to the system through an external power source.
Adjustments to the code can be made to customize the servo's movements.
